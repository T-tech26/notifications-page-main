### What I learned

It was really interesting working with a new skill, I built the project with a CSS framework tailwind css, so I learned how to use the tailwind css, though I'm not yet perfect using it, but I had the basic understanding on how to work with it. The project was really fun building and am looking forward on improving my skills with the tailwind css framework.

An example code of the tailwind css
```html
<h1 class="text-red-500 underline">Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

### Continued development

I'm looking forward on improving my skills on the following skills

- Tailwind css
- Tailwind css animations
- React js

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind css docs](https://www.tailwind.com/docs) - As the first time working with the tailwind framework, their documentations was really helpful to me, from installation to writing tailwind classes. So basically from start to the end of the project I made used of their documentations, so would recommend it to anyone starting off with tailwind css.
